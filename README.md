## Let's dive into each step in detail:

1. Importing the Required Libraries:
In this step, I have imported the necessary libraries required to implement the classification algorithms.

2. Importing the Dataset:
In this step, I have imported the weatherAUS.csv dataset that contains the observations of weather metrics for each day from 2008 to 2017. The dataset has additional columns like 'RainToday' and the target variable is 'RainTomorrow'.

3. Data Preprocessing:
In this step, I have performed data preprocessing tasks such as checking for missing values, handling categorical variables, feature scaling, etc.

4. Training Data and Test Data:
In this step, I have split the dataset into training data and testing data using the train_test_split function from Scikit-learn. I have used 70% of the data for training and 30% of the data for testing.

5. Linear Regression:
In this step, I have implemented the Linear Regression algorithm to predict whether it will rain tomorrow or not. I have evaluated the model using various evaluation metrics such as Accuracy Score, Jaccard Index, F1-Score, LogLoss, Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and R2-Score.

6. Decision Tree:
In this step, I have implemented the Decision Tree algorithm to predict whether it will rain tomorrow or not. I have evaluated the model using various evaluation metrics such as Accuracy Score, Jaccard Index, F1-Score, LogLoss, Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and R2-Score.

7. Logistic Regression:
In this step, I have implemented the Logistic Regression algorithm to predict whether it will rain tomorrow or not. I have evaluated the model using various evaluation metrics such as Accuracy Score, Jaccard Index, F1-Score, LogLoss, Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and R2-Score.

8. SVM:
In this step, I have implemented the SVM algorithm to predict whether it will rain tomorrow or not. I have evaluated the model using various evaluation metrics such as Accuracy Score, Jaccard Index, F1-Score, LogLoss, Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and R2-Score.

9. Report:
In this step, I have generated a report using the models that we created in the previous steps. The report includes various evaluation metrics for each model and the comparison of their performance.
